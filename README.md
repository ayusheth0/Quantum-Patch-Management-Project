# Quantum-Patch-Management-Project
Quantum Computing Project - Prioritizing Patch Management for Cybersecurity using a Quantum-inspired Vertex Cover Algorithm.
The project is as undertook by Alli Ajagbe and myself (Ayush Sheth).

This is the README file for the project as well as the repo.

Keep in mind, this is the personal work repo for Ayush Sheth. The work done by Alli Ajagbe is available at his GitHub repo - https://github.com/alliajagbe/patch-mgt

For checkpoint 1:
- We are addressing the literature review done already for the further creation and implementation of the project.
- The literature repo is i the Lit Rev QC file here. Similarly, one can be found on Alli's repo as well.
- The Desc file linked here is descriptions and details, in brief, about the learnings and meanings of the requisite for the project. Going through them will providde ample background about Patch Management, Vertex Cover Algorithm, and how Quantum Computing makes up this project.
- The progress report doc to be submitted is also added as Report.docx
